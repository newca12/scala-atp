### About ###
Port of the Objective Caml code supporting John Harrison's logic [textbook](http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521899574) Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning to Scala.

Ambassy is an EDLA project.

The purpose of [edla.org](http://www.edla.org) is to promote the state of the art in various domains.

### Other ports ###

[F#](https://github.com/jack-pappas/fsharp-logic-examples)

### Running examples with Scala Worksheet plugin for Eclipse ###
This is a very convenient way to play with Scala  
[Scala Worksheet plugin for Eclipse](https://github.com/scala-ide/scala-worksheet) is a glorified editor, with the option of evaluating the script and placing the results of each expression in a comment on the same line.  
All examples will be available in the [worksheets directory](https://github.com/newca12/scala-atp/tree/master/worksheets)  
The `worksheets` folder contains `*.sc` scripts corresponding to the original OCaml files. Within each `*.sc` file, examples appear in the same order as in the book; we have added a comment to each example with its page number in the book to make cross-referencing easier.

### Notes ###
We kept the file names of the original mostly intact, though use Scala naming conventions.  
Contain also a study about parsers and some code from :  
* [DSLs in Action](http://books.google.fr/books?id=SzD6RAAACAAJ&num=16&source=gbs_slider_cls_metadata_1003_mylibrary) from Debasish Ghosh  
* Eugen Labun's thesis : [Combinator Parsing in Scala](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7LbY7bJaltldVRhMHhfT1F4VkE/edit?pli=1)
